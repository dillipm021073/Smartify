## How It Works

### Customer Flow (When Order Items Are Saved)

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Step 1: Select Plan**
   - Customer chooses a plan (e.g., PLAN 1299)
   - Plan ID stored in state: `selectedPlan`

2. **Step 2: Select Device**
   - Customer chooses a device (e.g., iPhone 17 Pro Max)
   - Device ID stored in state: `selectedProduct`

3. **Step 3: Select SIM Type**
   - Customer chooses Physical, eSIM, or Dual SIM
   - SIM type stored in state: `selectedSIM`

4. **Step 4: Email & OTP Verification**
   - Customer enters email
   - System sends OTP (dev mode: always `123456`)
   - Customer verifies OTP
   - **Application is created** ‚Üí receives `application.id`

5. **Order Items Saved Automatically**
   ```typescript
   // After application creation (client/src/pages/CustomerPortal.tsx:961-1007)

   onSuccess: async (application) => {
     setApplicationId(application.id);

     // Save order items if plan and device are selected
     if (selectedPlan && selectedProduct) {
       await apiRequest("POST", `/api/applications/${application.id}/order-items`, {
         planId: selectedPlan,
         deviceId: selectedProduct,
         devicePrice: deviceData.basePrice,
         planPrice: planData.price,
         oneTimeCashout: Math.round(devicePrice * 0.13), // 13% down payment
         monthlyPayment: Math.round(devicePrice / planData.durationMonths)
       });

       console.log('‚úÖ Order items saved successfully');
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Customer Continues**
   - Completes ID verification, address, employment, etc.
   - Order items remain saved in database

---

### Agent Flow (When Order Items Are Retrieved)

**Step-by-Step Process**:

1. **Agent Logs In**
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - Receives: `agentId`, `storeId`

2. **Agent Searches Applications**
   - Uses search or filters
   - List endpoint returns basic application data (no order items)

3. **Agent Opens Application for Review**
   - Clicks "Start Review" on an application
   - **Detail endpoint is called**: `GET /api/agent/applications/:id`
   - Response includes **full order items** with plan and device details

4. **Order Summary Displayed**
   - üîµ **Mobile Plan Section**
     - Plan name, monthly fee, data, calls, features

   - üü£ **Device Section**
     - Device name, brand, model, full price

   - üü¢ **Payment Summary Section**
     - One-time down payment (13% of device price)
     - Monthly installment (device price / plan duration)
     - Total monthly payment (installment + plan fee)

## Why Some Applications Show "No Order Items"

**Existing applications** created before October 25, 2025 may show "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: No order items found" because:

1. **Created Before Fix**: Applications created before the error handling improvements
2. **Incomplete Checkout**: Customer abandoned checkout before selecting plan/device
3. **Testing Data**: Applications created during development/testing without proper flow

**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ **All NEW applications** created by customers will have order items saved
- ‚úÖ **Agents will see complete order details** for all new applications
- For old applications without order items, agents can manually ask customer for details
