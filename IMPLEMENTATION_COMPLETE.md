# Implementation Complete: Customer Order Tracking & MSISDN Assignment

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Issue Identified
The agent portal was **not displaying the customer's plan/device selections** from the customer journey (Steps 1-3). Additionally, there was **no way for agents to assign phone numbers (MSISDN)** to customers.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Database Schema Updates**
- Added `availableNumbers` table to store MSISDN pool
  - Fields: `id`, `msisdn`, `status`, `reservedFor`, `assignedTo`, `assignedAt`, etc.
  - Supports status tracking: `available`, `reserved`, `assigned`

#### 2. **Backend API Enhancements**

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/msisdn/available` - Fetch available phone numbers (limit: 50 default)
- `POST /api/agent/applications/:id/assign-number` - Assign MSISDN to application

**Storage Methods Added:**
- `getAvailableNumbers(limit)` - Get available MSISDNs
- `getNumberById(id)` - Get specific MSISDN
- `assignNumberToApplication(numberId, applicationId)` - Assign number
- `createAvailableNumber(data)` - Add new MSISDN to pool

**Enhanced Existing Endpoints:**
- Agent application details endpoint now returns `orderItems` with joined `plan` and `device` data
- Customer portal now saves order items when OTP is verified (after Step 3)

#### 3. **Customer Portal Updates**
**File:** `client/src/pages/CustomerPortal.tsx`

- After OTP verification (Step 3 ‚Üí 4 transition), the system now:
  1. Creates the application
  2. **Saves order items** with:
     - Selected plan ID and price
     - Selected device ID and price
     - Calculated one-time cashout (13% down payment)
     - Calculated monthly payment (device price / plan duration)

#### 4. **Agent Review Flow Updates**
**File:** `client/src/pages/AgentReviewFlow.tsx`

**Step 9 (Review Application) Now Displays:**

1. **Order Details Section** (NEW)
   - Selected Plan name and monthly price
   - Selected Device name and full price
   - One-time cashout amount
   - Monthly payment breakdown

2. **Customer Information**
   - Email and verification status
   - SIM type selected

3. **Identification**
   - ID type and number

4. **Application Metadata**
   - Cart ID, Application ID, Status, Timestamps

5. **MSISDN Assignment Section** (NEW)
   - Dropdown with 100+ available phone numbers
   - Visual indicator if number already assigned
   - "Assign Selected Number" button
   - Validation: Cannot proceed to Step 10 without assigned number

#### 5. **API Client Updates**
**File:** `client/src/lib/api.ts`

- Added `OrderItem` interface with plan/device details
- Updated `Application` interface to include `orderItems[]`
- Added `AvailableNumber` interface
- Added hooks:
  - `useAvailableNumbers(limit)` - Fetch available MSISDNs
  - `useAssignNumber()` - Assign MSISDN mutation
  - `useAgentApplicationDetails(applicationId)` - Fetch full app with order items

## üóÇÔ∏è Complete Agent Flow (As Designed)

### ‚úÖ Step 8: Store Assignment
- Agent picks up pending application
- System auto-assigns application to agent and store
- Status changes: `pending` ‚Üí `submitted`

### ‚úÖ Step 9: Review Application
- **Order Details**: Plan, Device, Pricing (NOW VISIBLE)
- **Customer Info**: Email, ID verification
- **MSISDN Assignment**: Agent selects and assigns phone number
- **Validation**: Must assign number before proceeding

### ‚úÖ Step 10: Privacy & Signature
- Privacy preferences collection
- Terms acceptance (3 required checkboxes)
- Digital signature capture
- Final submission ‚Üí Status: `submitted` ‚Üí `verified`

## üìã Database Seed Script

Created `seed-msisdn.js` to populate sample Philippine mobile numbers:

### Usage:
```bash
node seed-msisdn.js
```

### What It Does:
- Creates `available_numbers` table if it doesn't exist
- Generates 100 realistic Philippine mobile numbers (09XX XXX XXXX format)
- Inserts them with status `available`
- Prevents duplicates
- Reports insertion statistics

### Sample Numbers Generated:
- Covers major PH networks: Globe (09XX), Smart (09XX), Sun (09XX)
- Format: 0917 XXX XXXX, 0919 XXX XXXX, 0929 XXX XXXX, etc.

SELECT
  a.cart_id,
  a.email,
  a.assigned_number,
  an.status

LEFT JOIN available_numbers an ON a.assigned_number = an.msisdn;

-- Check available MSISDN count
SELECT COUNT(*) as available_count
FROM available_numbers
WHERE status = 'available';
```
